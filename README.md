## üëâGetting Started

Please follow these simple steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Server Side

- Create a copy of .env.example and name the file `.env`
- Set up Postgres DATABASE_URL in .env file. You can get a free PostgreSQL connection string from [Aiven.io](https://aiven.io/) or [Neon.tech](https://neon.tech/).
- Create a copy of wrangler.sample.toml and name the file `warngler.toml`
- Set up Prisma connection pool DATABASE_URL in wrangler.toml file. You can get this for free from [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/accelerate).
- Set up JWT Secret JWT_SECRET in wrangler.toml file. This can be any value.
- Login to ([cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)) and create a free account.
- Make sure you have logged in the cloudflare cli using npx wrangler login.
- Run npm run deploy

```bash 

cd backend
npm install
npm run prisma:migrate
npx prisma generate
npm run dev

```

> Note: wrangler.toml is the environment configuration file for a serverless backend. .env is used by Prisma for connection pooling. Ensure you configure both environment files accordingly.



### Client Side

- Navigate into the frontend directory using 
```bash

cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

```

> Note: `frontend/src/config.ts` contains `backendUrl`. If you need your frontend to point to local backend server, uncomment `export const BackendUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:8787/server/v1"`.
